        <b>SeavPhov</b> is a web-based application design to foster the process
        of book sharing among individuals. The primary object of this
        application is to connect individual who has used books that have the
        idea of sharing to others and those who need for reading or other usage
        without spending any money. The application also provides community
        feature for joining reading challenge as a personal annual achievement.

      <p class="h3">Problem Statement</p>
      <p>
        Even though we have online books now, many students still find it hard
        to get the textbooks they need for school. Textbooks cost a lot of
        money. This is tough for students, who might have to choose between
        buying books and paying for other important things. Students spend
        hundreds of dollars on textbooks each year [1], which can make it hard
        to do well in school. Plus, it's not always easy to find used books or
        rent them, so some students just can't get the books they need or they
        just use PDF format.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, students who finish college often have extra
        textbooks they don't use anymore. They spent a lot of time and money on
        these books, but then the books just sit around and might get thrown
        away, which is a waste. There are some ways to share or rent books
        though social media or friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes sharing books hard and not very popular. So, there's a need
        for something better and easier to use. Our new website will try to fix
        these problems. It will have a good search feature, community
        management, and reading challenges. This should make it easier for
        students to share books and create a group where people help each other
        get the books they need.

      <p class="h3">A Message From Our Creator</p>
      <p>
        After complete third year of my bachelorâ€™s degree, I found myself with a
        large number of textbooks that I no longer needed. These books
        represented a significant investment of time and money, yet they were
        getting dust on my shelves.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, I found out some students who are from the province,
        struggling with their academic journey when getting the necessary
        textbooks due to high cost and financial stability. This realization
        created the idea for a web-base application that could foster the
        process of sharing textbooks between students, ensuring that valuable
        resources are reused rather than wasted.
