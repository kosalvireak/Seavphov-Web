      <p class="h4">A Message From Our Co-Founder</p>
      <p>
        When I was in second grade, I discovered the Hardy Boys series. Ever
        since, I've loved to read — both for fun and to improve my mind. And I'm
        always looking for the next great book. One afternoon while I was
        scanning a friend's bookshelf for ideas, it struck me: when I want to
        know what books to read, I'd rather turn to a friend than any random
        person or bestseller list. So I decided to build a website – a place
        where I could see my friends' bookshelves and learn about what they
        thought of all their books. Elizabeth, my co-founder (and now my wife)
        wrote the site copy and I wrote the code. We started in my living room,
        motivated by the belief that there was a better way to discover and
        discuss good books, and that we could build it. Seavphov is that site.
        It is a place where you can see what your friends are reading and vice
        versa. You can create "bookshelves" to organize what you've read (or
        want to read). You can comment on each other's reviews. You can find
        your next favorite book. And on this journey with your friends you can
        explore new territory, gather information, and expand your mind.
        Knowledge is power, and power is best shared among readers.
